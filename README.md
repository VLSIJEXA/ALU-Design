# 4-Bit ALU Design

## Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog. The ALU can perform a variety of operations, including arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), logical operations (AND, OR, XOR), comparisons (greater than, less than), and bitwise operations (NOT, shifts).

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
- **Logical Operations**:
  - AND
  - OR
  - XOR
- **Comparison Operations**:
  - Greater than
  - Less than
  - Equality
- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - NOT
  - Left Shift
  - Right Shift
